Alice is an agent. Its "cognitive" state is composed of

The following line initializes the agent's state with a belief that gives what 
credentials it should use to interact with the simulated manufacturing line.

Below are Alice's plans. Whenever Alice has a goal, she will execute one of the
plans she knows shall achieve this goal. Plans are the core of the agent's
program, they dictate the overall behavior of the agent.

A plan has the following structure:

triggering_event : guard_condition <- action ; action ; ... action .

- tringgering events are the addition/deletion of beliefs and goals to the
agent's state, e.g. the addition of goal !getTD(<URI of a TD document>);
- the guard condition is a logical formula over beliefs;
- an action is a statement that has side effects in the agent's environment
(here, the environment is the Web).

Given the following plans, Alice can retrieve a TD document, list the
properties it contains, read and write those properties, and invoke actions.
That is, it can do what most WoT consumers should be able to do.

Exercises:

1. Edit the plan below to read the TD of the VL10 workshop and print its
properties to the console.

2. Re-write the plan so that Alice sets the conveyor speed of the VL10 workshop
to 0.5 (m/s) and then picks an item at position (0,0).

That will be all for now. More details about the Jason language will be given
in the MAS lecture.
